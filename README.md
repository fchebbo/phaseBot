Java application that mainly relies on Java Discord API to do its magic  https://github.com/DV8FromTheWorld/JDA
Other than that..it's just a bunch of string parsing and REST calls..more random stuff to be added, stay tooned!

# HOW TO USE:
1) Go to discord.gg, and make a bot https://discord.com/developers/docs/intro
2) Get the token from the bot, and update \src\main\resources\jda.properties with it
3) Invite the bot to your discord server
4) Start the app (Main.java)
5) (Extra Credit) - Host the bot in a cloud somewhere so that it's always on and ready to serve
